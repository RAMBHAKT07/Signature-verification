# Signature Verification

# Signature Verification using MobileNetV2

This project uses a deep learning approach for signature verification. We utilize MobileNetV2, a pre-trained convolutional neural network, to extract features from signature images and train a classifier to distinguish between genuine and forged signatures.

## Dataset

- **Number of Signatures**: 500
- **Images per Signature**: 7
- **Total Images**: 3,500

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Pillow

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python pillow
